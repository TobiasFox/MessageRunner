This is a HAW GameJam 4-player couch co-op game, developed in one week. The topic was "Die spinnen, die Jugendlichen...".  

For each player a message in their player-color is spawned in the abstract form of a sphere. When a player collects their message a smaller sphere, indicating  the color of the receiver of this message, is following them.  Score points by delivering the message to the correct receiver.
